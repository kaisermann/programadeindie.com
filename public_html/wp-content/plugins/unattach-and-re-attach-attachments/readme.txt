Allows to unattach and reattach images and other attachments from within the
media library page.

== Description ==

Wordpress allows to attach (or assign) images and other attachments organized
within the Media Library to posts and pages. A file will automatically be
attached when uploading it in the post creation form. There are also "Attach"
links in the Media Library to manually attach files to posts. Once attached
there is no way to unattach or re-attach images, pdfs or any attachment in
wordpress core.

This plugin fills this gap by providing two additional links next to "Attach" in the **Media Library**:

*   **Re-Attach**: Allows to choose a new post to attach the file to
*   **Unattach**: Totally removes an existing relation between an attachment and a post

= Bulk Actions =
The plugin also provides bulk actions for unattaching and re-attaching
multiple files at once! Just mark the files you want to change, select your
desired action from the *Bulk Actions* dropdown and hit *Apply*.

== Installation ==

Upload the plugin to your blog and activate it as any other plugin. **It will 
work out of the box**.

== Note ==
Thanks to [tamlyn](http://profiles.wordpress.org/tamlyn/) who created the plugin
[Unattach](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/unattach/) which inspired this
plugin.
