= Cloud Backup that just works =
A reliable backup is the backbone of any business. And we have a free monthly backup for all of your websites. It's, incremental, reliable, and works where other backup solutions fail.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is ManageWP free? =

ManageWP is using the freemium model. All the core features are free for an unlimited number of websites. And for those of you who need more, we have a set of premium features to help you out.

= Do you offer support for free users? =

Yes. No matter if you're free or premium user, we are here for you 24/7. Expect a 1h average response time and a 65% answer resolution in the first reply.

= How much do premium ManageWP features cost? =

Our pricing is highly flexible. We don't charge anything upfront, and the usage is calculated on a per-website, per-addon basis. Like Amazon Web Services. Check out our [pricing page](https://managewp.com/pricing "ManageWP pricing page") for more info.

= Is ManageWP secure? =

Yes. All of our code is developed in-house and we have a top notch security team. With half a million websites managed since 2012 we did not have a single security incident. We've accomplished this through high standards, vigilance and the help of security researchers, through our [white hat security program](https://managewp.com/white-hat-reward).

= I have websites on several different hosts. Will ManageWP work all of them? =

Yes. ManageWP plays nice with all major hosts, and 99% of the small ones.

= Does ManageWP work with multisites? =

Yes, multisite networks are fully supported, including the ability to backup and clone a multisite network.

= Does ManageWP work with WordPress.com sites? =

No. ManageWP works only with self-hosted WordPress sites.

= I have problems adding my site =

Make sure you use the latest version of the Worker plugin on the site you are trying to add. If you still have problems, check our dedicated [FAQ page](http://managewp.com/user-guide/faq/my-sites-fail-to-addload-to-managewp "Add site FAQ") or [contact us](http://managewp.com/contact "ManageWP Contact").

= How does ManageWP compare to backup plugins like BackupBuddy, Backwpup, UpdraftPlus, WP-DB-Backup ? =

There is a limit to what a PHP based backup can do, that's why we've built a completely different backup - cloud based, incremental, it keeps working long after others have failed.

= How does ManageWP compare with clone plugins like Duplicator, WP Migrate DB, All-in-One WP Migration, XCloner ? =

These solutions are simple A-B cloning solutions that tend to break in critical moments. ManageWP does it more intelligently. We first upload the backup archive to a cloud infrastructure that we control, and then we transfer it to the destination website. This effectively compartmentalizes the process into two separate steps, making the whole cloning experience much more robust and stress free.
